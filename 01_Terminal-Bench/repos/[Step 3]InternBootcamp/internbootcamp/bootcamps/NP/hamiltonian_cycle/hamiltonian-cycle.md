## Description
Your objective is to find a subgraph within a given graph G that contains a Hamiltonian circuit, which is a path that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point. The goal is to maximize the number of vertices included in the Hamiltonian circuit.

To solve this, start from a random vertex, find a valid small subgraph, and then try to expand the subgraph while ensuring that it remains valid. The process should continue until the largest possible valid Hamiltonian circuit is found. 

## Submission Format
The answer should be an ordered sequence of node IDs representing the Hamiltonian circuit found. The answer should be in the following format: [1, 4, 2, 1]. Note that the answer should not contain repeated nodes, and the first and last node must be the same. Additionally, the number of nodes in the Hamiltonian circuit should not exceed the maximum number of nodes in the graph. The following is the example about input and output format. 

## Example Input
