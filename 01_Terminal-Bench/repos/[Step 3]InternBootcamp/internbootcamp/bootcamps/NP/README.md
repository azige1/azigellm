# Introduction to NP Tasks
The folder structure you provided contains ten classic **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial-time)** tasks, each representing a fundamental challenge in the field of **computational complexity theory** — a branch of **theoretical computer science** that studies the inherent difficulty of computational problems. NP problems are central to understanding what computers can efficiently solve and form the foundation of algorithmic science, optimization, and artificial intelligence.

## 🧠 What Are NP Tasks?

An **NP problem** is one whose proposed solution can be *verified* in polynomial time, even if finding the solution itself may require exponential time. These problems often arise in real-world applications such as logistics, cryptography, network design, scheduling, and data mining.

The study of NP problems is a cornerstone of **computational science**, **operations research**, and **algorithmic complexity theory**, blending mathematics, computer science, and applied optimization.

## 🔬 The Ten NP Tasks in This Repository

| Task | Description | Scientific Domain |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **Hamiltonian Cycle** | Determine whether a path exists that visits each node exactly once and returns to the start. | Graph theory, combinatorial optimization |
| **Knapsack Problem** | Choose items with maximum total value without exceeding a weight limit. | Optimization, economics, logistics |
| **Maximum Clique Problem** | Find the largest subset of vertices such that every two are connected. | Network science, graph theory |
| **Maximum Set Problem** | Select the largest subset that satisfies given constraints. | Discrete mathematics, set theory |
| **Meeting Schedule** | Allocate time slots and participants to minimize conflicts and maximize efficiency. | Scheduling theory, operations research |
| **Minimum Cut** | Partition a graph into two disjoint subsets minimizing the number of crossing edges. | Network flow theory, computer networks |
| **Set Cover Problem** | Choose the fewest subsets that together cover all elements of a universal set. | Combinatorial optimization, data science |
| **Subset Sum** | Determine whether a subset of numbers sums to a target value. | Number theory, cryptography |
| **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** | Find the shortest route visiting all cities once and returning to the start. | Operations research, route optimization |
| **Graph Coloring (GCP_D)** | Assign colors to nodes so that adjacent nodes have different colors. | Graph theory, scheduling, compiler optimization |

## 🧩 Why NP Problems Matter

These NP problems are more than academic exercises — they form a **unified scientific framework** for studying complexity, optimization, and decision-making under constraints. Research in this area explores:
- How to approximate NP-hard problems efficiently.
- When exact solutions are computationally feasible.
- Theoretical limits of computation (e.g., the famous *P vs NP* question).

Thus, NP tasks lie at the intersection of **computer science**, **mathematics**, and **applied systems engineering**, forming a core component of the **science of computation and optimization**.
