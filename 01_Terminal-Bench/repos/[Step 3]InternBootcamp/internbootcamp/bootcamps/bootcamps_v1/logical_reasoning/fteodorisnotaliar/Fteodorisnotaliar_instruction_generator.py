Problem Details:
- Number of segments (n): {question_case['n']}
- Maximum coordinate (m): {question_case['m']}
Segments (each as 'li ri'):
{segments_str}

Task:
Calculate the largest possible number of questions Sasha can ask (xi, count) where knowing all answers doesn't confirm Fteodorisnotaliar's truthfulness. 

Rules:
1. Each xi must be unique, 1 ≤ xi ≤ {question_case['m']}.
2. Fteodorisnotaliar's segments have no common integer point.
3. Sasha doesn't know n initially.

Output Requirement:
Your answer must be a single integer inside [answer]...[/answer] tags. Example: [answer]4[/answer]"""
