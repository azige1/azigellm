However, his boss requires that any two consecutive coffee breaks on the same day must be at least {d} minutes apart. Your task is to determine the minimum number of days required and assign each coffee break to a specific day, ensuring that the breaks on the same day are spaced appropriately. Days are numbered starting from 1.

The coffee break minutes are: {a_str}

Your answer must be formatted as follows:

[answer]
<minimum number of days>
<space-separated day assignments in the order of the input>
[/answer]

For example, if the minimum days is 3 and the assignments are 1, 2, 1, the answer should be:

[answer]
3
1 2 1
[/answer]

Please ensure the answer is enclosed within [answer] and [/answer] tags."""
