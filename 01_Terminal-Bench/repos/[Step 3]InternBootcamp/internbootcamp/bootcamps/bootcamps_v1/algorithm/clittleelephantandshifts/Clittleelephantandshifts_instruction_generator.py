Problem Statement:

The Little Elephant has two permutations a and b of length n, where n is a positive integer. The distance between two permutations is defined as the minimum absolute difference between the positions of a common element in a and in some cyclic shift of b. For each of the n cyclic shifts of permutation b, determine the distance to permutation a.

Input Format:

The input consists of:
- The first line contains an integer n, the size of the permutations.
- The second line contains permutation a as n distinct integers separated by spaces.
- The third line contains permutation b in the same format.

Output Format:

Output n lines, each containing one integer. The i-th line should correspond to the distance between permutation a and the i-th cyclic shift of permutation b.

Cyclic Shift Explanation:

A cyclic shift by i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) of permutation b is formed by taking the first i elements and moving them to the end. For example, if b is [3,4,2,1], the 1st cyclic shift is [3,4,2,1], the 2nd is [4,2,1,3], the 3rd is [2,1,3,4], and the 4th is [1,3,4,2].

Examples:

Sample Input 1:
2
1 2
2 1

Sample Output 1:
1
0

Sample Input 2:
4
2 1 3 4
3 4 2 1

Sample Output 2:
2
1
0
1

Your Task:

Compute the distance for each cyclic shift of b and output them in order. Ensure your answer has exactly n lines, each with a single integer. Place your final answer within [answer] tags, like this:

[answer]
<output line 1>
<output line 2>
