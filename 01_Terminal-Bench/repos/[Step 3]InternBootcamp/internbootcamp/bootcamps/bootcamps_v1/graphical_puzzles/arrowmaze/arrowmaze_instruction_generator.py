    ### Instructions:

    1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.
    2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.
    3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.
### Puzzle Rule:
1.The maze consists of a grid with an arrow in each grid cell pointing in one of eight directions up, down, left, right, or diagonally.
2.The maze has a well-defined start and end point.
3.The player starts at the starting point, moves to the next grid cell in the direction indicated by the arrow, and then continues to move as indicated by the arrow in the new grid.
4.The player must move strictly in the direction indicated by the arrows and cannot go in the opposite direction or choose another path.
5.The game is won when the player successfully reaches the end from the starting point.

### Question

Now the grid of the arrow maze is:\n{identity["input_grid"]}
The start position is {identity["start_position"]} and the end position is 'o' in the grid.

The answers are required to point out the position of each inflection point in order, 0 indicates a point not on the path.

说明：
透彻理解所提供的规则。如有需要，将规则拆解为更简单的组成部分或步骤。
仔细运用规则来解决给出的问题。
核实你的答案，确保其与规则以及谜题的情境相符。
谜题规则：
迷宫由一个网格构成，每个网格单元格中有一个箭头，指向八个方向之一，即上、下、左、右或对角线方向。
迷宫有明确规定的起点和终点。
玩家从起点出发，按照箭头所指方向移动到下一个网格单元格，然后继续按照新网格中箭头所指方向移动。
玩家必须严格按照箭头指示的方向移动，不能朝相反方向移动或选择其他路径。
当玩家成功从起点抵达终点时，游戏获胜。
问题
现在箭头迷宫的网格如下：
\n{identity["input_grid"]}

起点位置是 (0, 0)，终点位置是网格中的 “○”。
答案需要按顺序指出每个转折点的位置，0 表示不在路径上的点。
