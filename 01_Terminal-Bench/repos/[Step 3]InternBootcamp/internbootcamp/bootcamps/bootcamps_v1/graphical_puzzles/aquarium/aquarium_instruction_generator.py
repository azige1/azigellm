- The grid has {rows} rows and {cols} columns.

- Aquarium regions are as follows (each number represents the aquarium ID for that cell):
{regions_table}

- Each row has a clue on the right indicating the total filled cells in that row. The row clues are: {row_clues}.

- Each column has a clue at the bottom indicating the total filled cells in that column. The column clues are: {col_clues}.

Your task is to determine the water level for each aquarium. The water level is the highest row number filled (0-based from the bottom). Each aquarium's water level must be such that all its columns are filled up to this level.

Provide your answer as a list of integers in column order (from left to right), where each integer is the water level for the corresponding column's aquarium. Enclose your answer within [answer] and [/answer]. For example, if the solution is levels 2, 1, 0 for columns 0, 1, 2, write:
[answer]2 1 0[/answer]"""
