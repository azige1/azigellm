    ### Instructions:
    
    1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.
    2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.
    3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.
    
### Campsite Puzzle Rule:

1.The game is played on an n*m grid with trees at some locations in the grid.
2.To place tents on the grid.
3.Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., above, below, to the left, or to the right of the tree).
4.Tents cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to other tents.
5.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.
6.Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.
7.The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the tree, and X, which represents the spaces,To the right and below the matrix are numerical constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.

### Question
